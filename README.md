# Theia [0.6.0] 

Personal viewBOOSTing software. As opposed to throwing cheap, obviously fake views at youtube, Theia will manage a large number of hyper-realistic bot accounts.

The challenge when view botting on YouTube is that - considering the relatively large amount of money they give to creators - YouYube has gotten very good at tracking bots. They check your IP, your browser session behavior, and I've heard even the keyboard and mouse the system is using. The cost and computing power to circumvent these measures is fucking grandious. Therefore, Theia compromises in two areas while still delivering artificial success on Youtube: (1) Instead of view *botting* it instead view *boosts* and (2) utilizes bots on other websites.

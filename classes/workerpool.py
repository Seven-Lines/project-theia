""" -----| THREAD POOL EXECUTOR CLASS
Allows for the creation of multiple different uses of the bots 
while keeping the program running at all times. This feature allows 
me to focus the efforts of the bots, even as the program runs 24/7. 
On a whim I can change the focus of the bots from reconnaissance to 
targeting one of my videos. 

In theory I should be able to create multiple thread pools.
